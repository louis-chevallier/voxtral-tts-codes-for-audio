# Voxtral TTS Audio Autoencoder - Gradient-Based Discrete Code Reconstruction

**Disclaimer**: It is a research experiment!

Reconstruct audio by training AE discrete bottleneck codes [num_frames, 37] using gradient descent through Voxtral's frozen decoder. This approach replaces the missing encoder with optimization-based code learning for a specific audio. Here we directly train codes for the select audio during many single-sample epochs.

**Key Idea**: Given target audio and a frozen decoder, find the optimal discrete codes that reconstruct it using differentiable quantization (Gumbel-Softmax + STE) and multi-objective losses. 

**⚠️ Note**: ~1 hour training on Mac M-series yields good results (5000 epochs). Works for single audio reconstruction.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download Voxtral-4B-TTS weights to voxtral-tts-weights/
# From: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-4B-TTS-2603
hf download mistralai/Voxtral-4B-TTS-2603 --local-dir "voxtral-tts-weights"
```

### Train Audio Reconstruction

```bash
python training_script.py \
  --reference-audio casual_female_clean.wav \
  --model-path voxtral-tts-weights \
  --num-epochs 5000 \
  --learning-rate 0.1 \
  --device mps  # or cuda/cpu
```

Output saved to: `checkpoints/final_output.wav`
Saved trained codes: `checkpoints/final_codes.pt` - example how to read them at the bottom of `codecs2audio.ipynb`
Example result (5000 epochs): `casual_female_reconstructed.wav` in root folder
